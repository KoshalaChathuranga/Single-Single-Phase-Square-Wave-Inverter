    Objective:
        Design and implement a single-phase inverter system capable of converting DC power to AC power with a square wave output.

    Components:
        LM5104 MOSFET driver for controlling MOSFET switching.
        MOSFETs for power switching.
        Microcontroller for PWM signal generation and control.
        Voltage sensors for feedback control.
        DC power source (battery or rectified AC).

    Operation:
        The microcontroller generates PWM signals to control the switching of MOSFETs.
        MOSFETs are arranged in an H-bridge configuration to produce the square wave output.
        The duty cycle of the PWM signals determines the width of the square wave, regulating the output voltage.
        Voltage sensors provide feedback to the microcontroller, enabling voltage regulation and stability.

        Demonstrations in educational settings to illustrate principles of inverter operation and PWM control.
        Integration into standalone renewable energy systems for off-grid power generation.

    Benefits:
        Provides a simple and cost-effective solution for converting DC to AC power.
        Offers flexibility for various applications requiring square wave AC output.
        Enhances understanding of power electronics principles and inverter design.

    Future Enhancements:
        Implementing more advanced control algorithms for improved efficiency and performance.
        Integrating protection mechanisms for overvoltage, overcurrent, and temperature monitoring.
        Exploring alternative waveform generation techniques for different applications.
